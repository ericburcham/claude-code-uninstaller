# Claude Code Uninstaller

**[PowerShell Version Available](README-WINDOWS.md)** - If you're on Windows without WSL or other bash support, there is a PowerShell version.

Anthropic's native binary installation (currently in beta) doesn't provide an uninstall method. This script removes both npm and native binary installations completely.

**Use Anthropic's official uninstall when they release one.** This is a temporary solution.

## Why This Exists

The native binary installation lacks proper uninstall functionality, and having both npm and native binary versions installed can cause conflicts and break your local setup. Common issues include:

- Mixed installations pointing to different binaries
- Shell completions from both versions conflicting  
- PATH resolution picking the wrong installation
- npm's uninstall failing with ENOTEMPTY errors

This script provides a clean slate by removing all Claude Code installations and configurations, regardless of how they were installed.

## Usage

```bash
chmod +x uninstall-claude.sh
./uninstall-claude.sh
```

**Options:**
- `--force` - Skip prompts
- `--quiet` - Silent mode (implies --force, perfect for scripts)
- `--help` - Show help

**Examples:**
```bash
# Interactive (asks before removing ~/.claude)
./uninstall-claude.sh

# Automation/CI-CD
./uninstall-claude.sh --quiet
```

## What Gets Removed

- **Binaries**: `~/.local/bin/claude`, `/usr/local/bin/claude`, etc.
- **NPM packages**: Global installations and broken leftovers
- **Shell configs**: Removes Claude lines from `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc. (creates backups)
- **Data directory**: `~/.claude` (prompts unless --force)

## Safety Features

**Shell config backups**: Before modifying any shell config file, creates timestamped backups:
```bash
~/.zshrc.claude-backup.20250904-143022
```

**Path validation**: Only removes the expected `~/.claude` directory, refuses to delete unexpected paths.

**Binary safety**: Only removes files ending with `/claude` from PATH to prevent accidents.

**Exit codes**: Returns 0 on success, non-zero if any major operation failed (good for CI/CD).

## NPM-Only Users

Just use npm's official command:
```bash
npm uninstall -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

But if that fails with ENOTEMPTY errors (common), run this script instead.

## Troubleshooting

**"Could not remove" warnings:**
```bash
# Script shows exact commands to run
sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/claude
```

**Claude still in PATH after uninstall:**
1. Restart terminal
2. Run `./cc-uninstall.sh --force` again

**For automation:**
Script returns exit code 0 on success, non-zero if issues occurred.
